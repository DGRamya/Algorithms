Basic algorithms 
1.Guessing Game :
    This program can be used to check whether a required element is there in the huge list of catalog. Suppose we want to search for item     in catalog, that contains 356789453 items, this game will take not more than 29 guesses to check whether the required item is present     in the catalog.

    The algorithm we have used here is binary search which takes O(logn) to find an element in any sorted list
2.MinSubArrVal:Given a startIndex and array, the function indexOfMinimum will find the minium value's position in the subarray(startIndex,array.length).
If we execute this in a loop, array will be sorted by finding minimum element and swapping it to the right poistion, which is the logic of Selection sort. Time complexity is O(n2).
